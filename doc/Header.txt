METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header->new($accessor, $ie)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording header object. $accessor is a
        reference to a "Beyonwiz::Recording::Accessor" used to carry out the
        media file access functions in "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header". <$ie>
        is a reference to a "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry" used to
        retrieve name and path information for the recording.

    "$h->accessor([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the media file accessor object reference.

    "$h->ie([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the associated "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry".

    "$h->path;"
        Returns folder name part of the path in the associated
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry".

    "$h->name;"
        Returns index name in the associated
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry".

    "$h->headerName([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the name of the header document (file name part
        only).

    "$h->magic([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the header magic number (0x1062). Returns "undef" if
        the header is for a media file.

    "$h->version([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the header version number (0x1062). Returns "undef"
        if the header is for a media file.

    "$h->pids([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) a reference to a list of Packet IDs (PIDs) for the
        recording. "$h->pids->[0]" is the video PID, "$h->pids->[1]" is the
        main audio pid, "$h->pids->[2]" is the Program Clock Reference (PCR)
        PID and "$h->pids->[3]" is the Program Map table PID for the
        recorded program. Returns "[0, 0, 0, 0]" if the header is for a
        media file.

        The lowest-order 13 bits of the values contain the PID
        "$h->pids->[$n] & 0x1fff". The remaining bits are reserved for
        flags. The only known flag is 0x8000 in the main audio PID, which
        indicates that the audio AC3 (rather than MPEG-2).

    "$h->pid($n);" =item "$h->pidFlags($n);"
        Two utility that return, respectively, "$h->pids->[$n] & 0x1fff" and
        "$h->pids->[$n] & ~0x1fff", the corresponding true PID value from
        "$h->pids->[$n]" and the flags component.

        Both methods return 0 if the header is not for a Beyonwiz recording.

    "$h->isTV; $h->isRadio; $h->isMediaFolder $h->isMediaFile"
        Returns true if "$h->validMain;" is true and the recording is
        respectively digital TV, digital radio, a Beyonwiz folder format for
        large media files, or a single media file. All can return false if
        "$h->headerName" has not been set.

    "$h->lock([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the flag implementing the Beyonwiz File Lock on the
        recording.

    "$h->full([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the full flag. Purpose unknown. Unused in WizFX.

    "$h->inRec([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the "currently recording" flag.

    "$h->service([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording service (LCN) name.

    "$h->title([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording title (event name). Returns the
        non-folder part of recording's index name if it has no title set.
        Any leading ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1f) in the header value
        are stripped off.

    "$h->episode([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording episode name (subtitle). Any leading
        ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1f) in the header value are
        stripped off.

        In free-to-air EPGs, this field is sometimes used as the program
        synopsis (see "$h->extInfo"), rather than the episode name.

    "$h->extInfo([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording extended information (program
        synopsis). Any leading ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1f) in the
        header value are stripped off.

    "$h->longTitle([$addEpisode[, $sep]];"
        Returns "$h->title . '/' . $h->episode" if the episode name can be
        loaded and is non-empty, otherwise returns "$h->title". If
        $addEpisode is specified and false, the episode name is not added in
        any case. If $sep is specified, it is used instead of '/' as the
        separator between title and episode name.

    "$h->mjd([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording start date. The name suggests that it
        is the Modified Julian Date, but it isn't.

        "$h->mjd == int(true_MJD + time_zone_offset_in_minutes/(24*60))"
        where "time_zone_offset_in_minutes" is the time zone setting in
        minutes current at the start of the recording.

        The Beyonwiz appears to keep local time rather than UTC as its
        internal time.

    "$h->start([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) number of seconds into the day indicated by "$h->mjd"
        when the recording started.

    "$h->last([$val]); $h->sec([$val]);"
        Return (set) two parameters describing the recording duration. The
        recording duration in seconds is: "$self->last*10 + $self->sec".
        "$h->playtime" is a convenience method that calculates the playtime
        from *last* and *sec*.

    "$h->endOffset([$val]);"
        Return the offset of the logical end of the recording. Returns a
        "bignum".

    "$h->offsets([$val]);"
        Return (set) the table of offsets (possibly at even time intervals?)
        of logical file offsets (as described in "$h->endOffset([$val]);").
        Offsets are returned as "bignum"s.

        If the offsets are at even intervals, it's probably 10 seconds.

        For efficiency reasons, only populated for "$h->load(1)".

    "$h->noffsets;"
        Returns the number of offsets.

    "$h->bookmarks([$val]);"
        Return (set) the table of bookmarks (possibly at even time
        intervals?) of logical file offsets (as described in
        "$h->endOffset([$val]);"). Offsets are returned as "bignum"s.

        For efficiency reasons, only populated for "$h->load(1)".

    "$h->nbookmarks;"
        Returns the number of bookmarks.

    "$h->validMain;"
    "$h->validEpisode;"
    "$h->validExtInfo;"
    "$h->validBookmarks;"
    "$h->validOffsets;"
        Returns true if the last "$h->loadMain;" (resp. "$h->loadEpisode",
        "$h->loadExtInfo", "$h->loadBookmarks", or "$h->loadOffsets") was
        successful.

    "$h->size;"
        Returns the size of the header file (256kB).

    "$h->playtime"
        A convenience method that returns the duration of the recording in
        seconds.

    "$h->starttime"
        Returns a Unix-like timestamp for the start time of the recording in
        local time (rather than in UTC, like a true Unix timestamp). More
        precisely, returns the number of seconds since midnight at the start
        of 1 Jan 1970, *plus* the number of seconds in the timezone offset
        at the time the recording was started.

        This can be converted into the calender/clock fields for the local
        time at the start of the recording using "gmtime" (*not*
        "localtime").

        The local time fields can then be converted into a genuine Unix
        timestamp using "Time::Local::timelocal".

    "$h->offsetTime($offset)"
        Convert an offset into a time. "$h->loadOffsets" must have been
        called, otherwise -1 is returned. Interpolates between values in the
        offset table. Returns 0 if "$offset <= $self->offsets->[0]" and
        "$self->playtime" if "$offset >= $self->endOffset".

    "$h->loadMain;"
    "$h->loadHdrWmmeta;"
    "$h->loadHdrFile;"
    "$h->loadEpisode;"
    "$h->loadExtInfo;"
    "$h->loadBookmarks;"
    "$h->loadOffsets;"
        Load parts of the header object from the header on the Beyonwiz.
        "$h->loadMain" loads the basics, "$h->loadEpisode" loads the episode
        name/subtitle informtion, "$h->loadExtInfo" loads the extended event
        informtion, "$h->loadBookmarks" loads the bookmark information and
        "$h->loadOffsets" loads the 10-second offset data.

        "$h->loadHdrWmmeta;" and "$h->loadHdrFile;" load as much of the
        header as possible with information about media content either in
        the Beyonwiz folder format for large files ("$h->loadHdrWmmeta;"),
        or in single files ("$h->loadHdrFile;").

    "$h->decodeMain($hdr_data)"
    "$h->decodeEpisode($hdr_data)"
    "$h->decodeExtInfo($hdr_data)"
    "$h->decodeBookmarks($hdr_data)"
    "$h->decodeOffsets($hdr_data)"
        Decodes parts of the header object from $hdr_data on the Beyonwiz.
        The data for each part is assumed to satart at the beginning of the
        respective $hdr_data.

        "$h->decodeMain" decodes the basics, "$h->decodeEpisode" decodes the
        episode name/subtitle informtion, "$h->decodeExtInfo" decodes the
        extended event informtion, "$h->decodeBookmarks" decodes the
        bookmark information and "$h->decodeOffsets" decodes the 10-second
        offset data.

INTERNAL METHODS

    "$h->_setUnixTime($time);"
        Set "$h->mjd([$val]);" and "$h->start([$val]);" from the given Unix
        time (seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1 1097 UTC).

    "$h->_setMainMediaFile($size, $time);"
        Set as many fields as possible to reasonable values given the size
        and timestamp of a media file.

    "$h->_readHdrChunk($offset, $size);"
        Read a chunk of the header file. Reads from
        "$h->headerName([$val]);" if it is defined, otherwise tries reading
        from "TVHDR" then "RADHDR" and sets the header name from the first
        to succeed. Reads $size bytes at byte offst $offset from the start
        of the header file.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Utils", "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape",
    "Time::Local", "File::Basename".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    The bugs to do with time are in the Beyonwiz.
