DESCRIPTION

    List, fetch, move or delete the recordings on a Beyonwiz DP series PVR
    over the network using the *WizPnP* interface. If --indir is specified,
    perform the same operations on the computer where *getWizPnP* is
    running. --indir is most useful in combination with --ts.

    If no pattern arguments are given, then all recordings are listed.
    Otherwise recordings matching any of the patterns are fetched (or
    listed, moved or deleted, with --list, --move or --delete respectively).

    In the absence of --regexp or --expression a pattern matches if it is a
    substring of the string *servicename*#*longtitle*#*date*, case
    insensitive. The *longtitle* is just the title if the header has no
    episode information, otherwise it is *title*/*episodename*.

    For example:

        SC10 Canberra#MOVIE: Pride & Prejudice#Fri Feb 15 20:28:00 2008

    or

        WIN TV Canberra#Underbelly/Team Purana#Wed May  7 20:28:00 2008

    To download all recordings, an empty string will match everything:

        wizGetPnP ''

    Recordings are copied or moved to a name corresponding to their event
    name (title) with any characters that are illegal in the file system
    changed to '_'. The --date option adds the day and date of the recording
    to the name, and the --episode option adds the episode name to the
    recording name (if there is one set) -- helpful for series recordings.
    Downloaded recordings are placed in the current directory unless
    --outdir has been specified.

    When listing recordings, recordings that are currently recording are
    flagged with "*RECORDING NOW" next to the recording name. The tag is not
    part of the name for matching. *GetWizPnP* won't fetch recordings that
    are currently in progress.

ARGUMENTS

    GetWizPnP takes the following arguments:

    help
          --help
          -h

        Print a short help message and exit (overrides all other options).

    device
          --device=dev
          -D device

        Connect to the WizPnP *device* as named in the Beyonwiz
        "Setup>Network>WizPnP>Name".

        If no *device* is named and the WizPnP search finds only one WizPnP
        device, that device is used. Otherwise, if a device is named but
        isn't found, *getWizPnP* returns with an error. Device name matching
        is case-insensitive ("MyBeyonwiz" matches "mybeyonwiz").


          --maxdevs=devs
          -D devs

        In a WizPnP search, stop searching when the number of WizPnP devices
        found is *devs*, rather than waiting for the search to time out
        (currently 60 seconds). *Devs* defaults to 1.

    host
          --host=host
          -h host

        Connect to the *host* (DNS name or dotted-quad IP address) instead
        of using WizPnP search to find the Beyonwiz, or instead of the
        default set in the configuration file (see FILES below).

        If the device name is specified with --device then the configuration
        returned by *host* that contains the WizPnP name of the device must
        match (case insensitive) the device name given by --device.

    port
          --port=port
          -p port

        Connect to the *port* instead of the file default (49152), or the
        default set in the configuration file (see FILES below). *port* is
        ignored unless --host is set.

    list
          --list
          -l

        List the matching recordings, rather than copying them.

    delete
          --delete
          -X

        Delete the matching recordings, rather than copying them.

    move
          --move
          -M

        Move the specified recordings to the output directory. Equivalent to
        a copy followed by a delete for each matching recording.

    date
          --date
          -d
          --nodate
          --nod

        Add the recording day and date to the name of the recording when
        it's downloaded. Useful for downloading series.

    episode
          --episode
          -E
          --noepisode
          --noE

        Add the recording episode name (if there is one) to the name of the
        recording when it's downloaded. Useful for downloading series.

    ts
          --ts
          -t
          --nots
          --not

        Download the recordings as single ".ts" (MPEG Transport Stream)
        files, rather than copying in the Beyonwiz internal recording
        format.

        --nots and --not undo the setting of this option; useful if this
        option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    resume
          --resume
          -R
          --noresume
          --noR

        Allow resumption of downloading of recordings that appear to be
        incomplete.

    resume
          --force
          -f
          --noforce
          --nof

        Allow downloads to overwrite existing recordings that appear to be
        complete.

    verbose
          --verbose
          -v

        Provide more information. A single -v lists some more details about
        the recordings, and shows a progress indicator when copying. The
        progress indicator shows the transfer rate for the last megabyte
        copied while the transfer is running, and the average transfer rate
        for the copy when the copy completes. Two -v options list the sizes
        of the recording file chunks on the Beyonwiz.

    quiet
          --quiet
          -q

        The opposite effect of --verbose. Useful if $verbose is non-zero in
        the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    regexp
          --regexp
          -r
          --noregexp
          --nor

        Carry out the matches using the argument as a case-insensitive Perl
        regular expression. For example:

            getWizPnP --regexp 'ABC|SBS'

        will copy all recordings made from either the ABC or SBS.

        --noregexp and --nor undo the setting of this option; useful if this
        option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    expression
          --expression
          -e
          --noexpression
          --noe

        Evaluates the match arguments as Perl expressions with $_ set to the
        *servicename*#*title*#*date* string. If any expression evaluates to
        true (in Perl terms), the recording is matched.

            getWizPnp --expression '/ABC|SBS/i'

        is equivalent to the --regexp example above. Quite powerful; the
        Swiss Army knife approach.

        --noexpression and --noe undo the setting of this option; useful if
        this option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    outdir
          --outdir=dir
          -O dir

        Save the recordings in *dir* rather than in the current directory.

    indir
          --indir=dir
          -I dir

        Look for recordings in *dir* on the local computer rather than on
        the Beyonwiz.

    List
          --List
          -L

        Produce only a list of the index names of the recordings in the
        recording index file. Intended for use by GUIs or other programs
        calling *getWizPnP*.

    BWName
          --BWName
          -B

        The pattern arguments are recording index names as listed by --List.
        Can find Beyonwiz recordings faster than other matching methods,
        because it doesn't scan the whole file list. Unlike the other
        matching methods, must be an exact string match. Not very
        user-friendly. Intended for use by GUIs or other programs calling
        *getWizPnP*.

FILES

    The file ".getwizpnp" is searched for in the user's "HOME" directory, if
    "HOME" is set, or in the current directory if "HOME" is not set. If
    ".getwizpnp" exists, it is run as a piece of Perl code by *getWixPnP*
    just after the program defaults for options are set, and just before
    command-line options are set.

    It is probably most useful for setting the default --device or --host
    option, or making "--episode" set by default.

    An example ".getwizpnp" file is included with *getWizPnP*, in the file
    "getwizpnp.conf".

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPRecording", "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileIndex",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileHeader", "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileTrunc",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileRecording", "HTTP::Status", "Getopt::Long".

BUGS

    Although a limited amount of testing has not found any problems, it is
    uncertain whether deleting a recording on the Beyonwiz while it is
    currently being watched can cause any malfunction on the Beyonwiz.
    Normally, the playback of the recording is stopped with an error message
    shortly after the recording is deleted. This may be impolite to he
    person watching, but so far does not appear to affect the Beyonwiz
    beyond that.

    The WizPnP search requires the use of the Perl package
    "IO::Socket::Multicast". This is available for download from CPAN for
    Mac OS X, Linux and Cygwin running under Windows. It is available only
    through and alternative PPM ActivePerl archive for Windows.
    Unfortunately, that version of "IO::Socket::Multicast" does not appear
    to work with the same code that works with the CPAN version.

    If "IO::Socket::Multicast" is not available, *getWizPnP* will exit with
    an error. In this case, the Beyonwiz device must be specified using
    --host (and --port if necessary).

    See README.txt in the distribution for details on how to install ant
    modules that *getWizPnP* needs to allow it to run on your system.

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    When resuming a download, may fetch up to 32MB more data than is
    necessary.
