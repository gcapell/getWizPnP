    network using the WizPnP interface

SYNOPSIS

        getWizPnP [-h|--help] [-D dev|--device dev] [-m devs|--maxdev=devs]
                  [-h host|--host=host] [-p port|--port=port]
                  [-l|--list] [-d|--date] [-t|--ts] [-v|--verbose]
                  [-r|--regexp] [-e|--expression] [-O dir|--outdir dir]
                  [ patterns... ]

DESCRIPTION

    List or fetch the recordings on a Beyonwiz DP series PVR over the
    network using the WizPnP interface.

    If no pattern arguments are given, then all recordings are listed.
    Otherwise recordings matching any of the patterns are fetched (or
    listed, with --list).

    In the absence of --regexp or --expression a pattern matches if it is a
    substring of the string *servicename*#*title*#*date*, case sensitive.
    For example:

        SC10 Canberra#MOVIE: Pride & Prejudice#Fri Feb 15 20:28:00 2008

    To download all recordings, an empty string will match everything:

        wizGetPnP ''

    Recordings are downloaded to a name corresponding to their event name
    (title) with any characters that are illegal in the file system changed
    to '_'. The --date option adds the day and date of the recording to the
    name, helpful for series recordings. Downloaded recordings are placed in
    the current directory.

ARGUMENTS

    GetWizPnP takes the following arguments:

    help
          --help
          -h

        Print a short help message and exit (overrides all other options).

    device
          --device=dev
          -D device

        Connect to the WizPnP *device* as named in the Beyonwiz
        "Setup>Network>WizPnP>Name".

        If no *device* is named and the WizPnP search finds only one WizPnP
        device, that device is used. Otherwise, if a device is named but
        isn't found, *getWizPnP* returns with an error. Device name matching
        is case-insensitive ("MyBeyonwiz" matches "mybeyonwiz").

        Note: There is a problem with the implementation of this function
        and it can take up to 60 seconds (average 30 seconds) to search for
        the WizPnP devices on the network. Until this problem is fixed, you
        may prefer to use the --host option.


          --maxdevs=devs
          -D devs

        In a WizPnP search, stop searching when the number of WizPnP devices
        found is *devs*, rather than waiting for the search to time out
        (currently 60 seconds). *Devs* defaults to 1.

    host
          --host=host
          -h host

        Connect to the *host* (DNS name or dotted-quad IP address) instead
        of using WizPnP search to find the Beyonwiz, or instead of the
        default set in the configuration file (see FILES below).

        If the device name is specified with --device then the configuration
        returned by *host* that contains the WizPnP name of the device must
        match (case insensitive) the device name given by --device.

    port
          --port=port
          -p port

        Connect to the *port* instead of the file default (49152), or the
        default set in the configuration file (see FILES below). *port* is
        ignored unless --host is set.

    list
          --list
          -l

        List the matching recordings, rather than downloading them.

    date
          --date
          -d

        Add the recording day and date to the name of the recording when
        it's downloaded. Useful for downloading series.

    ts
          --ts
          -t
          --nots
          --not

        Download the recordings as single ".ts" (MPEG Transport Stream)
        files, rather than copying in the Beyonwiz internal recording
        format.

        --nots and --not undo the setting of this option; useful if this
        option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    verbose
          --verbose
          -v

        Provide more information. A single -v lists some more details about
        the recordings, and shows a progress indicator when copying. Two -v
        options list the sizes of the recording file chunks on the Beyonwiz.

    quiet
          --quiet
          -q

        The opposite effect of --verbose. Useful if $verbose is non-zero in
        the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    regexp
          --regexp
          -r
          --noregexp
          --nor

        Carry out the matches using the argument as a Perl regular
        expression. For example:

            getWizPnP --regexp 'ABC|SBS'

        will copy all recordings made from either the ABC or SBS.

        --noregexp and --nor undo the setting of this option; useful if this
        option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    expression
          --expression
          -e
          --noexpression
          --noe

        Evaluates the match arguments as Perl expressions with $_ set to the
        *servicename*#*title*#*date* string. If any expression evaluates to
        true (in Perl terms), the recording is matched.

            getWizPnp --expression '/ABC|SBS/'

        is equivalent to the --regexp example above. Quite powerful; the
        Swiss Army knife approach.

        --noexpression and --noe undo the setting of this option; useful if
        this option is set by default in the user's ".getwizpnp" file.

    outdir
          --outdir=dir
          -O dir

        Save the recordings in *dir* rather than in the current directory.

FILES

    The file ".getwizpnp" is searched for in the user's "HOME" directory, if
    "HOME" is set, or in the current directory if "HOME" is not set. If
    ".getwizpnp" exists, it is run as a piece of Perl code by *getWixPnP*
    just after the program defaults for options are set, and just before
    command-line options are set.

    It is probably most useful for setting the default --device or --host
    option.

    An example ".getwizpnp" file is included with *getWizPnP*, in the file
    "getwizpnp.conf".

BUGS

    There is a problem with the implementation of the WizPnP search function
    and it can take up to 60 seconds (average 30 seconds) to search for the
    WizPnP devices on the network. Until this problem is fixed, you may
    prefer to use the --host option.

    File copy progress bar only updates after each (up to) 32MB recording
    chunk is copied.

    It's not possible to restart interrupted transfers.

    If the --ts flag is given, downloading a recording to the same name will
    overwrite the original; if it's not given an error results. It's not
    completely clear what the correct behaviour should be.

    Can only download to the current directory.

    The implementation of WixPnP search is slow; the Beyonwiz doesn't
    respond to the WizPnP search multicast.

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.
