NAME

    getWizPnP - list and fetch recordings from a Beyonwiz DP series over the
    network using the WizPnP interface

SYNOPSIS

        getWizPnP [-h host|--host=host] [-p port|--port=port]
                  [-l|--list] [-|--date] [-t|--ts] [-v|--verbose]
                  [-r|--regexp] [-e|--expression]
                  [ patterns... ]

DESCRIPTION

    List or fetch the recordings on a Beyonwiz DP series PVR over the
    network using the WizPnP interface.

    If no pattern arguments are given, then all recordings are listed.
    Otherwise recordings matching any of the patterns are fetched (or
    listed, with --list).

    In the absence of --regexp or --expression a pattern matches if it is a
    substring of the string *servicename*#*title*#*date*, case sensitive.
    For example:

        SC10 Canberra#MOVIE: Pride & Prejudice#Fri Feb 15 20:28:00 2008

    To upload all recordings, an empty string will match everything:

        wizGetPnP ''

    Recordings are uploaded to a name corresponding to their event name
    (title) with any characters that are illegal in the file system changed
    to '_'. The --date option adds the day and date of the recording to the
    name, helpful for series recordings. Uploaded recordings are placed in
    the current directory.

ARGUMENTS

    GetWizPnP takes the following arguments:

    host
          --host=host
          -h host

        Connect to the *host* (DNS name or dotted-quad IP address) instead
        of the file default ("beyonwiz"), or the default set in the
        configuration file (see FILES below).

    host
          --port=port
          -p port

        Connect to the *port* instead of the file default (49152), or the
        default set in the configuration file (see FILES below).

    list
          --list
          -l

        List the matching recordings, rather than uploading them.

    date
          --date
          -d

        Add the recording day and date to the name of the recording when
        it's uploaded. Useful for uploading series.

    ts
          --ts
          -t

        Upload the recordings as single ".ts" (MPEG Transport Stream) files,
        rather than copying in the Beyonwiz internal recording format.

    verbose
          --verbose
          -v

        Provide more information. A single -v lists some more details about
        the recordings, and shows a progress indicator when copying. Two -v
        options list the sizes of the recording file chunks on the Beyonwiz.

    regexp
          --regexp
          -r

        Carry out the matches using the argument as a Perl regular
        expression. For example:

            getWizPnP --regexp 'ABC|SBS'

        will copy all recordings made from either the ABC or SBS.

    expression
          --expression
          -e

        Evaluates the match arguments as Perl expressions with $_ set to the
        *servicename*#*title*#*date* string. If any expression evaluates to
        true (in Perl terms), the recording is matched.

            getWizPnp --expression '/ABC|SBS/'

        is equivalent to the --regexp example above. Quite powerful; the
        Swiss Army knife approach.

PREREQUSITES

    Uses packages "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index", "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc", "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry",
    "File::Basename", "Getopt::Long", "HTTP::Status", "LWP::Simple", "URI",
    "URI::Escape"

BUGS

    File copy progress bar only updates after each (up to) 32MB chunk file
    is copied.

    It's not possible to restart interrupted transfers.

    If the *--ts* flag is given, uploading a recording to the same name will
    overwrite the original; if it's not given an error results. It's not
    completely clear what the correct behaviour should be.

    Can only upload to the current directory.

    Doesn't use the WizPnP protocol to find WixPnP servers.
