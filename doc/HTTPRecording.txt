        use Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPRecording;

SYNOPSIS

    Download recordings from the Beyonwiz.

SUPERCLASS

    Inherits from "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPRecording->new($base, $ts, $date, $resume,
    $force)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording downloader object. $base is the base
        URL for the Beyonwiz device. If $ts is true, the download will be
        into a single ".ts" file, otherwise the recording will be copied as
        it is on the Beyonwiz. If $date is true, the recording date is added
        to the recording name. Useful for downloading series recordings. If
        $resume is true, allow resumption of recording download that appear
        to be incomplete. If $force is true, allow a download to overwrite
        an existing download.

    "$r->base([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the device base URL. The recording URL path name is
        set when the recording is downloaded. The object is intended to
        allow a sequence of recordings to be downloaded.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::Recording",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc", "Beyonwiz::Utils", "LWP::Simple", "URI",
    "URI::Escape", "HTTP::Status", "POSIX".

BUGS

    The progress callback may have inaccuracies when transferring a
    recording as-is from the Beyonwiz if the recording has been edited or
    made from the timeshift buffer.

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.
