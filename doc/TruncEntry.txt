NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry;

SYNOPSIS

    Represents an entry in the Beyonwiz trunc file.

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry->new($wizOffset, $fileNum, $flags,
    $offset, $size)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording index entry object. $wizOffset
        logical byte offset of the entry in the recording ("bignum").
        $filenum is the numbered recording file that the entry refers to.
        The file name is this number printed in "printf" %04d format. $flags
        - flags for the entry - unknown purpose. $offset - offset of the
        recording data chunk in the file ("bignum"). $size - size of the
        recodding data chunk in the file. More than one
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index" can refer to a given file.

        Normally constructed from the Beyonwiz trunc file by
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc".

    "$te->wizOffset([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the logical byte offset of the entry in the
        recording.

    "$te->filenum([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the numbered recording file that the entry refers to.

    "$te->flags([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the flags for the entry - unknown purpose.

    "$te->offset([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the offset of the recording data chunk in the file
        ("bignum").

    "$te->size([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the size of the recodding data chunk in the file.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Utils".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.
