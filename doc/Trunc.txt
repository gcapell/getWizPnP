SYNOPSIS

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc;

SYNOPSIS

    Provides access to the Beyonwiz recording trunc file. The trunc file is
    used to describe exactly which parts of the 0000, 0001, etc. files are
    included in the viewable recording.

CONSTANTS

    "TRUNC"
        The trunc url path component for the beyonwiz ("trunc").

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc->new($name, $base, $path)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording index object. $name is the default
        name of the recording (usually the name in the Beyonwiz recording
        index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"). $base is the base URL for
        the Beyonwiz device. $path is the path part of the recording URL
        (usually the path in the recording index).

    "$t->base([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the device base URL.

    "$t->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording URL.

    "$t->name([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the default recording name.

    "$t->entries([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the array reference containing the
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry" objects in for the recording.

    "$t->size;"
        Returns the size of the last loaded trunc file.

    "$t->recording_size;"
        Returns the sum of all the *size* entries in the
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry" objects in for the recording.

    "$i->valid;"
        Returns true if the last "$i->load;" succeeded.

    "$i->load;"
        Load the trunc file from the Beyonwiz.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry", "File::Basename",
    "LWP::Simple", "URI::Escape", "URI".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    Uses a fixed value for the path name of the index, rather than deriving
    it from *locationURL* in "Beyonwiz::WizPnP".
