NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPHeader;

SYNOPSIS

    Provides access to the Beyonwiz recording file header via HTTP.

SUPERCLASS

    Inherits from "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPHeader->new($name, $base, $path)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording header object. $name is the default
        name of the recording (usually the name in the Beyonwiz recording
        index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"). $base is the base URL for
        the Beyonwiz device. $path is the path part of the recording URL
        (usually the path in the recording index).

    "$h->base([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the device base URL.

    "$h->name([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the default recording name.

    "$h->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording URL path part.

    "$h->url([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording URL.

    "$h->load([$full])"
        Load the header object from the header on the Beyonwiz. The
        *offsets* data is only loaded if $full is present and true. If $full
        is not set, only 2kB is downloaded, otherwise 256kB is downloaded.

    "$h->readHdrChunk($offset, $size)"
        Read a chunk of the header file length $size at offset $offset.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header", "Beyonwiz::Utils",
    "File::Basename", "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    The bugs to do with time are in the Beyonwiz.
