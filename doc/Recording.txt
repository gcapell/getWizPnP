SYNOPSIS

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::Recording;

SYNOPSIS

    Download recordings from the Beyonwiz.

CONSTANTS

    "INDEX"
        The index url path for the beyonwiz ("index.txt").

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Recording->new($base, $ts, $date)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording downloader object. $base is the base
        URL for the Beyonwiz device. If $ts is true, the download will be
        into a single ".ts" file, otherwise the recording will be copied as
        it is on the Beyonwiz. If $date is true, the recording date is added
        to the recording name. Useful for downloading series recordings.

    "$r->base([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the device base URL. The recording URL path name is
        set when the recording is downloaded. The object is intended to
        allow a sequence of recordings to be downloaded.

    "$r->ts([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the single-file TS flag.

    "$r->date([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the flag controlling whether the recording date is
        added to the recording name.

    "$r->get_recording_file_chunk($path, $name, $file, $outdir, $append,
    $off, $size);"
        Download a chunk of a recording corresponding to a single
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry".

        $path is the URL path to the folder containing the recording's files
        on the Beyonwiz. $name is the name of the recording folder or file
        (if "$r->ts" is true). $file is the name of the Beyonwiz file
        containing the chunk. $append is false if $file is to be created,
        true if it is to be appended to. $off and $size is the chunk to be
        transferred. If $outdir is defined and not the empty string, the
        record file is placed in that directory, rather than the current
        directory.

    "$r->get_recording_file($path, $name, $outdir, $file, $append);"
        Download a complete 0000, 0001, etc. recording file from the
        Beyonwiz. Note that more than one "Beyonwiz::Recording::TruncEntry"
        may refer to any given file.

        $path, $name, $outdir, $file and $append are as in
        *get_recording_file_chunk*.

    "$r->get_recording($hdr, $trunc, $path, $outdir, $show_progress);"
        Download a Beyonwiz recording, either as a direct copy from the
        Beyonwiz, or into a single ".ts" file (if "$r->ts" is true). $hdr is
        the recording's header file object, $trunc is the recording's trunc
        file object, and $path is the path name from the recording's
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry". If $outdir is defined and not the
        empty string, the recording is placed in that directory, rather than
        the current directory. The name of the downloaded recording is
        derived from the recording title in the $hdr, with the recording
        date appended if "$r->date" is true. If $show_progress is not
        "undef" it is called as a function with "bignum" arguments
        ($file_size, $done), where $file_size is the size of the transfer,
        and $done is the amount transferred already. Both in bytes.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape", "HTTP::Status",
    "File::Basename".

BUGS

    The progress callback may have inaccuracies when transferring a
    recording as-is from the Beyonwiz if the recording has been edited or
    made from the timeshift buffer.

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.
