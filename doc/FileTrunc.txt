NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::FileTrunc;

SYNOPSIS

    Provides access to the Beyonwiz recording trunc file. The trunc file is
    used to describe exactly which parts of the 0000, 0001, etc. files are
    included in the viewable recording.

CONSTANTS

    "TRUNC"
        The trunc url path component for the beyonwiz ("trunc").

SUPERCLASS

    Inherits from "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileTrunc->new($name, $path)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording file index object. $name is the
        default name of the recording (usually the name in the Beyonwiz
        recording index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"). $path is the
        path part of the recording URL (usually the path in the recording
        index).

    "$t->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording path.

    "$t->load;"
        Load the trunc file from the Beyonwiz.

    "$t->fileTruncFromDir;"
        Return a new "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileTrunc" that reflect the files
        in the the directory pointed to by "$t->path([$val])".

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Recording", "Beyonwiz::Utils", "File::Basename",
    "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape", "File::Spec::Functions".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    Uses a fixed value for the path name of the index, rather than deriving
    it from *locationURL* in "Beyonwiz::WizPnP".
