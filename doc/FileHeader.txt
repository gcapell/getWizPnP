        Create a new Beyonwiz recording header object. $name is the default
        name of the recording (usually the name in the Beyonwiz recording
        index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"). $path is the path part of
        the recording filename (usually the path in the recording index).

        Returns (sets) the name of the header document (path part only).

    "$h->isTV; $h->isRadio;"
        Returns true if "$h->valid;" is true and the recording is digital TV
        (resp digital radio).

    "$h->load([$full])"
        Load the header object from the header file. The *offsets* data is
        only loaded if $full is present and true. If $full is not set, only

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    The bugs to do with time are in the Beyonwiz.
