SYNOPSIS

    Provides access data for the Beyonwiz devices on the local network using
    WizPnP.

CONSTANTS

    "DESC"
        The URL path part for the WizPnP device descriptor document on the
        Beyonwiz PVR ("tvdevicedesc.xml";

    "SSDPADDR"
        The IP multicast address used for Simple Service Discovery Protocol
        (SSDP) used to search for PnP devices (239.255.255.250).

    "SSDPPORT"
        The IP multicast port number used for Simple Service Discovery
        Protocol (SSDP) used to search for PnP devices (1900);

    "SSDPPEER"
        *SSDPADDR*:<SSDPPORT>; "239.255.255.250:1900"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::WizPnP->new"
        Create a new Beyonwiz WizPnP search object.

    "$wpnp->devices([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the reference to the hash of discovered devices
        ("Beyonwiz::WizPnPDevice"), indexed by the lower-case version of the
        device name.

    "$wpnp->device_names;"
        Returns the list of discovered device names. All lower-cased. No
        particular order.

    "$wpnp->device_names;"
        Returns the list of discovered device names. All lower-cased. No
        particular order.

    "$wpnp->device($name);"
        Return the named device's "Beyonwiz::WizPnPDevice" entry. Lookup is
        case-insensitive.

    "$wpnp->ndevices;"
        Returns the number of discovered devices.

    "$wpnp->add_device($location);"
        Request the device description XML from the URL given in $location,
        and install the device "Beyonwiz::WizPnPDevice" into $wpnp.
        $location is typically the "LOCATION" header in the response to an
        SDDP "M-SEARCH" request.

    "$wpnp->process($data);"
        Process an SDDP "M-SEARCH" response (or, for now, an SSDP "NOTIFY"
        message) in $data, and install the device pointed to by the
        "LOCATION" header in the message.

        Returns true if the message contained an installable SSDP device.

    "$wpnp->search([$maxdev]);"
        Search the local net for Beyonwiz PnP devices and install them in
        $wpnp.

        If $maxdev is supplied and non-zero, terminate the search when
        $maxdev devices have been installed.
