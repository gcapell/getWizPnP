        use Beyonwiz::Recording::FileIndexEntry;

SYNOPSIS

    Represents an entry in the Beyonwiz recordings index..

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileIndexEntry->new($name, $fullPath,
    [$makeSortTitle])"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording index entry object. $name is the
        default name of the recording. $fullPath is the full path of the
        recording. This is the right-hand part of a "index.txt" entry for a
        recording. The last segment of this path is not used when
        constructing a URL or a file path (for local recordings).
        $makeSortTitle is a function reference that takes a single string
        argument, and its return value is used to construct
        "$ie->sortTitle([$val]);". It should transform its input string to
        the form used for comparisons when sorting.

        Normally constructed from the Beyonwiz recording index by
        "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index".

    "$ie->name([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the default name of the recording. This is the
        left-hand part of a "index.txt" entry for a recording.

    "$ie->fullPath([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the full path of the recording. This is the
        right-hand part of a "index.txt" entry for a recording. The last
        segment of this path is not used when constructing a file path.

    "$ie->extractDetails;"
        Extracts the remaining information fields for the index entry from
        "$ie->name([$val]);". Called automatically from the constructor.

    "$ie->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) path part of the recording file path.

    "$ie->title([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the program title. Constructed automatically from
        $val when "$ie->name([$val]);" sets the recording name. This title
        is similar to, but not identical with, the title saved in the
        recording header file.

    "$ie->sortTitle([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) a sorting value for "$ie->title([$val]);".
        Constructed automatically as "$ie->makeSortTitle($ie->title);" when
        "$ie->name([$val]);" sets the recording name.

    "$ie->folder([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the name of the recording folder on the Beyonwiz.
        Constructed automatically from $val when "$ie->name([$val]);" sets
        the recording name.

    "$ie->sortFolder([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) a sorting value for "$ie->folder([$val]);".
        Constructed automatically as "lc $ie->folder([$val]);" when
        "$ie->name([$val]);" sets the recording name or "$ie->path([$val]);"
        sets the recording path.

    "$ie->time([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording start time as a Unix *time(2)* value.
        Constructed automatically from $val when "$ie->name([$val]);" sets
        the recording name.

    "$ie->makeSortTitle([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the function used to construct
        "$ie->sortTitle([$val]);" when "$ie->name([$val]);" sets the
        recording name.
