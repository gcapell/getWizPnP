NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPTrunc;

SYNOPSIS

    Provides access to the Beyonwiz recording trunc file. The trunc file is
    used to describe exactly which parts of the 0000, 0001, etc. files are
    included in the viewable recording.

CONSTANTS

    "TRUNC"
        The trunc url path component for the beyonwiz ("trunc").

SUPERCLASS

    Inherits from "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::HTTPTrunc->new($name, $base, $path)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording file index object. $name is the
        default name of the recording (usually the name in the Beyonwiz
        recording index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"). $base is the
        base URL for the Beyonwiz device. $path is the path part of the
        recording URL (usually the path in the recording index).

    "$t->base([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the device base URL.

    "$t->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the path part of the recording URL.

    "$t->url([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the recording URL.

    "$t->load;"
        Load the trunc file from the Beyonwiz.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc", "Beyonwiz::Utils",
    "File::Basename", "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    Uses a fixed value for the path name of the index, rather than deriving
    it from *locationURL* in "Beyonwiz::WizPnP".
