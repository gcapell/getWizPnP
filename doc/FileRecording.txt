NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::FileRecording;

SYNOPSIS

    Download recordings from the Beyonwiz.

SUPERCLASS

    Inherits from "Beyonwiz::Recording::Index"

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::FileRecording->new($path, $ts, $date, $resume,
    $force)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording downloader object. $path is the base
        path for local Beyonwiz recordings. If $ts is true, the download
        will be into a single ".ts" file, otherwise the recording will be
        copied as it is on the Beyonwiz. If $date is true, the recording
        date is added to the recording name. Useful for downloading series
        recordings. If $resume is true, allow resumption of recording
        download that appear to be incomplete. If $force is true, allow a
        download to overwrite an existing download.

    "$r->path([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) recording path name.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::Recording",
    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Trunc", "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header",
    "Beyonwiz::Utils", "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape", "HTTP::Status",
    "File::Basename", "File::Spec::Functions", "POSIX".

BUGS

    The progress callback may have inaccuracies when transferring a
    recording as-is from the Beyonwiz if the recording has been edited or
    made from the timeshift buffer.

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.
