NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Recording::Stat;

SYNOPSIS

    Provides access to the Beyonwiz recording stat file. The purpose of the
    stat file isn't really known.

CONSTANTS

    "STAT"
        The stat url path component for the Beyonwiz ("stat").

METHODS

    "Beyonwiz::Recording::Stat->new($accessor, $name, $path)"
        Create a new Beyonwiz recording file index object. $accessor is a
        reference to a "Beyonwiz::Recording::Accessor" used to carry out the
        media file access functions in "Beyonwiz::Recording::Header". $name
        is the default name of the recording (usually the name in the
        Beyonwiz recording index, see "Beyonwiz::Recording::IndexEntry".
        $path is the path to the source recording folder in $name, and can
        be a file system path or a URL depending on the type of $accessor.

    "$s->name([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the default recording name.

    "$s->fileName([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the name of the stat file.

    "$s->beyonwizFileName([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the name of the stat file in the source.

    "$s->recordingEndOffset([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) the logical file offset of the end of the recording
        as stred in the stat file.

    "$s->size;"
        Returns the size of the last decoded stat file.

    "$s->load;"
        Loads the stat data from the "stat" file, depending on which id
        present in the recording.

    "$s->valid;"
        Returns true if the last "$i->load;" or
        "$t->reconstruct($targetLen);" succeeded.

    "$t->reconstruct($targetLen);"
        Attempts to reconstruct the *stat*.

        $targetLen is the size of the recorded data (or the best estimate if
        not known exactly).

        Sets "$t->valid;" and "$t->reconstructed;" to true if the
        reconsruction succeeded (even partially), otherwise sets it to
        "undef".

    "$s->reconstructed([$val]);"
        Returns (sets) a flag marking that the object represents a
        reconstructed file, and the file should be encoded from the object
        rather than being copied from the source.

        Reset whenever "$s->valid;" is reset. Set when
        "$t->reconstruct($targetLen);" succeeds.

    "$s->decode($hdr_data);"
        Load the contents of $s by decoding the "stat" file data in
        $hdr_data.

PREREQUISITES

    Uses packages: "Beyonwiz::Recording::StatEntry", "Beyonwiz::Utils",
    "File::Basename", "LWP::Simple", "URI", "URI::Escape",
    "File::Spec::Functions".

BUGS

    Uses "bignum" for 64-bit integers, even when the underlying Perl
    integers are 64 bits.

    Uses a fixed value for the path name of the index, rather than deriving
    it from *locationURL* in "Beyonwiz::WizPnP".
