NAME

        use Beyonwiz::Utils;

SYNOPSIS

    Some utilities that don't belong anywhere else.

FUNCTIONS

    "makeAccessors($package, @fields)"
        Make accessor methods in a class in $package for the fields listed
        in @fields.

        If a method of the same name as the field already exists, don't make
        an automatic accessor for it. Because of this, calling
        *makeAccessors* multiple times for the same class and fields is
        save, but inefficient.
